Welcome to the Code section of this website. Bookmark this page and check back from time to time, as I am going to write about the programming business, what I know already, what I am actively learning myself and between us we shall become better developers (hopefully!). Join me on this journey. Some of this content will be free and some will be subscription based.

What I know, don't know, would love to know or perhaps not too fussed about...

# PHP
Throughout this site wherever I refer to PHP, I will pretty much be talking about Laravel which is the best framework of it's kind. However recently I have fallen behind with it, having got to a comfortable stage in the past, I now need to restore my knowledge to where it was in the past.

# .NET
I used to work with .NET but haven't used it in a number of years since front-end work has distracted me from my old path, which was predominantly .NET. Will I get back into it? I am not certain at this stage.

# JavaScript
The language i work with the most often and typically through Node, React and Vue. Vue and Laravel work well together as a complete stack. You could also use Node as a back-end or any other RESTful API out there.

# Python
A new one on me to be honest but I am going to learn it in 2020 and write about it on this website. I know that Python can be fun and that we could do funky stuff with it such as fly drones!

# Other
There are other areas of course that I've not mentioned above and that is because this whole section is a working document rather than a traditional blog, it's content will change wherever it needs to and the whole point of this process is to constantly evaluate my key areas of expertise.

I will at some point cover servers, mobile apps, desktop apps and databases but they might crop up under articles where I talk about PHP or JavaScript. Please bear with me on this, it will go from strength to strength.

- [ ] this is the previous content for this page, do I need any of this or can it be deleted?


I have for many years worked with "code" or "programming" as we used to call it and since currently I am working with the fabulous Vue.js framework, I thought it was high time I started to write about it and to offer my own range of courses to teach others why it is so brilliant and to build wonderful apps of your own.

There are a whole load of learninb resources online and I want to offer something a bit different that will fit in better with your busy day. You want to learn the new stuff or brush up on what you've done in the past but can't quite recall. In the meantime, here are some of the best resources that inspire me.
