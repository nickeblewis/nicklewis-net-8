## In general

### Contracts & Freelance

Currently working part-time for a digital agency and filling the rest of the time with projects of my own such as my ongoing course writing and other things. So please contact me if you need me for projects.

### Website updates
My website nicklewis.net is to become what is known as a Digital Garden, so will be less blog and more like a Wiki. essentially less diary and more documentary.

* Guides section is based on a template I took from somewhere else and will in fact work very well for my photowalks section. So the name Guides could be re-named as such.
* Would be great to check whether paths in the file and folder hieararchy convert to well to website paths?

## What I am looking at for this site

* https://convertkit.com/?lmref=Zp1z7w as seen on Joel Hooks website

What would convertkit offer over other similar tools? I quite like Substack but then I keep chopping and changing on it's theme all of the time which I want to avoid in the future.

* Substack and Nick Lewis or convertkit

* https://www.patreon.com/taniarascia - Hmmm Patreon and Tania is making 500 dollars from it a month
