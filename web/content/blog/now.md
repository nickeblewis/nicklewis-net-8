## In general
Currently working part-time for a digital agency and filling the rest of the time with projects of my own such as my ongoing course writing and other things. So please contact me if you need me for projects.

## What I am looking at for this site
- https://convertkit.com/?lmref=Zp1z7w as seen on Joel Hooks website
- MDX Starter kit for Gatsby if I were to change from Gridsome which is unlikely ;-)
- https://github.com/joelhooks/joelhooks-com
- https://joelhooks.com/using-egghead
- https://joelhooks.com/writing-with-rhythm
- https://joelhooks.com/thinking-backwards-is-the-way-to-plan
- https://joelhooks.com/the-egghead-podcast
- https://joelhooks.com/consult - I should have one of these calendars on my site!
- https://calendly.com/
- https://www.jparkers.co.uk/5-fruit-tree-collection
- https://www.andrewrowland.com/using-the-zend-framework-lucene-library/ - just like the fact he starts off in dark mode, I want my site to do this and like the fonts and sizes here too
- Substack and Nick Lewis or convertkit
- https://www.taniarascia.com/
- https://www.patreon.com/taniarascia - Hmmm Patreon and Tania is making 500 dollars from it a month
- https://www.taniarascia.com/adding-comments-to-my-blog/
- Which leads me to https://utteranc.es/ an interesting Github app that enables Git based comments on my site.... interesting!
